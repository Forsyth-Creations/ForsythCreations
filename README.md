# ForsythCreations
This repository serves to provide CAD files to any project that Henry Forsyth has made public. If you use these designs, I give you permission to distribute them, but you may not sell them. These are free for a reason, and I want everyone to have access to them. Mind you, you may charge material cost if you do print/give them out, but that is all!
