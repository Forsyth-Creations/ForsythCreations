Hello Mr.Furze,

I hope these files find you well. You'll see two folders: 

	Original: 
		In this folder, you'll find two files... An STL and a STEP file. The STEP looks a lot 
		more impressive than the STL, and it is easily editable in either SolidWorks or Fusion. I figured you might
		want it. If you open it in the right software, I believe it will retain the colors I assigned to each part. 

	Specifically for 3D Print: 
		These files are specifically designed to be 3D printed. They aren't 1 for 1 like
		the original CAD, but my hope is it will be easier to 3D print, and will retain
		its shapes better. Just know you might need some superglue for assembly. I don't 
		think a blowtorch will work well on this drift trike :)


All these files are as close to scale as I could divine from your videos. For 3D printing, especially on that TazBot I've seen, I'd recommend
a scale of 12%


Best wishes for a healthier tomorrow,
